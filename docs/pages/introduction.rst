Introduction
============

This open source project aims to facilitate versatile numerical tools to
efficiently compute the dynamics of quantum systems that are possibly strongly
coupled to a structured environment. It allows to conveniently apply the so
called time evolving matrix product operator method (TEMPO) [1], as well as
the process tensor TEMPO method (PT-TEMPO) [2].
