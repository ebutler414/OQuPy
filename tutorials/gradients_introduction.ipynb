This needs to be calculated which is shown below. The middle term is the derivative of the final state with respect to the system propagators. This is the computationally difficult part that is performed by the forward-propagation and back-propagation in the adjoint method. Finally the first term is the derivative of the objective function with respect to the final state, which we will later show that in the case of fidelity between a pure target state $|\\sigma\\rangle$ and $\\rho_f$, reduces to simply $\\sigma^T$, but more generally this will also need to be calculated.\n",

    "Broadly speaking, `oqupy.gradient` requires a system, an initial state and a target state in hilbert space, a process tensor, from which it can compute $\\frac{\\partial\\rho_f^i}{\\partial U^{jk}_n}$. Additionally, `oqupy.gradient` requires `dprop_dparam_list` which is given in the form of a list of $(d^2_{H_S},d^2_{H_S})$ matrices in Liouville space which are $\\frac{\\partial U^{jk}_n}{\\partial c_a}$, as well as `dprop_times_list`, an array of the times that corrispond to the $\\frac{\\partial U^{jk}_n}{\\partial c_a}$ in that position in the list. These are all requirements in order to perform a `oqupy.gradient` call, and the result is returned within a `oqupy.GradientDynamics` instance. If $\\frac{\\partial\\rho_f^i}{\\partial U^{jk}_n}$ is already known, it is possible to re-use this result with a different list of $\\frac{\\partial U^{jk}_n}{\\partial c_a}$, by passing the `oqupy.GradientDynamics` instance to the `oqupy.gradient` function, and the new `dprop_dparam_list` and `dprop_times_list`. Since the adjoint method has already been computed, there is no need to supply the initial or target state, however a process tensor and system instances are still necessary to construct the deriviatives.\n",
